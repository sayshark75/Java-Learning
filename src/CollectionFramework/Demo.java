package CollectionFramework;

// Collection framework:-
// Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is 
// known as the collection of the objects.

// **Collection framework:** it defines several predefined classes and
//interfaces which can be used to represent group of object as single object.

// In Java The Collection framework standardize the way in which group of 
// objects are handled uniformly.

// They are like a container, where we can store and manipulate group of object 
// in a standard way.

// Note: With the help of array also we can create group of multiple object as a 
// single entity(object).**

// Example:
// Student[] students = new Student[3];
// students [o] = new Student();
// students [1] = new Student();
// students [2] = new Student();
// in the above Student array we can handle 3 student object also.

// Difference between array and collection framework:**

// Drawback of array of objects

// 1 - Size is fixed, 
// 2 - Homogeneous data => overcome as below 
// Object[] objects = new Object[3];
// objects[o] = new Student();
// objects[o] = new Employee();
// objects[o] = "Hello";
// 3 - array concepts are not implemented using some ready made dataStructure

// there are two parts
// Normal Collection : Handle Data (Group of objects) individually
// Map : group of object in the form of key-value pair
