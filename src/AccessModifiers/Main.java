package AccessModifiers;

// there are four Access Modifiers
// 1 - Default :  It is similar to public as long as it is in the same  Package,
// 				  but in other package it become private
// 				  Default is a Primary Access Modifier.
// 2 - Public : Accessibility is Global (an access in any class or packages)
// 3 - Private : Accessibility restricted to that class only
// 4 - Protected : It is similar to Default, but outside the package 
//                 we can access by using Inheritance 
//  			   (Outside package a class who extends the class)

// the access modifiers are  accessible to the classes, Methods, Variables, and Constructors

// It Represents Accessibility outside the class or outside the package

// a Normal class (outer class/ parent class) can only be public or Default,
// whereas an inner classes (Child class/class nested in another package) 
// can be public, protected or private also
